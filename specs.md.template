## Data Conventions

This page presents GPU specifications, following a standardized data structure to ensure clarity and consistency:

- **Unsupported Precision:**
  The value `N/A` indicates that a specific precision (e.g., FP8) is **not natively supported** by the GPU.

- **Missing Data:**
  The value `?` means that the information is currently unavailable or not confirmed.
