# GPU Specifications for AI Projects

Welcome to the **GPU Specifications for AI Projects** repository!  
This project aims to centralize detailed specifications for GPUs, particularly in the context of AI workloads. 

## Why This Project?

Finding comprehensive and accurate GPU specifications for AI can be challenging. Many sources are either incomplete, inconsistent, or unavailable. This repository consolidates information into a single, accessible resource to assist AI researchers, developers, and enthusiasts.

If you believe this project duplicates an existing effort, or if a similar database already exists, please let us know by opening an issue or contacting us directly. Collaboration or linking efforts can benefit the entire community!

## Whatâ€™s Included?

The core of this project is a [JSON database](data/specs.json) containing detailed specifications of GPUs:
- Precision support (e.g., FP32, FP16, INT8, etc.)
- Compute & Memory capabilities
- Additional details relevant to AI workloads

The JSON data is rendered into:
- [HTML](https://g.masse.me/gpu-specs) for easy browsing.
- [Markdown](specs.md) for lightweight documentation.

## Contributing

If you spot errors, have missing data, or can add reliable sources, we welcome your input!
See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for details.

## Roadmap

- Add missing specifications for GPUs.
- Expand support to cover GPUs from various vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, etc.).
